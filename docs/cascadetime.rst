Model: Non-progressive Cascade Process (CASCADETIME)
====================================================================

Description:
------------
In each replication, we simulate non-progressive cascade(s) process within a finite time :math:`\tau`. The non-progressive cascade process is similar
to the progressive one (see the .rst file for CASCADE) but within a finite tiem horizon and including the probability of becoming inactive 
at each time step :math:`\beta_v` for node :math:`v \in V`. Besides, the initial node activation probabilities become :math:`u_v^t \in [0,1] \forall v \in V,
t = \{1, 2, \ldots, \tau\}`, which is time-dependent.

According to Kempe et al. 2003, we can reduce the non-progressive cascade progress to the progressive one, The reduction can be achieved by transforming the original
graph :math:`G` to a layered graph :math:`H = (V', E')` on :math:`\tau \cdot |V|` nodes, where :math:`V'` consists of :math:`v_t^i` for each node :math:`i` in :math:`G`
and each time-step :math:`t \leq \tau`. :math:`E'` is obtained by connecting each node in :math:`H` with itself and its neighbors in :math:`G` indexed by the previous time step.
The edge weight is specified as follows: :math:`p(v_t^i, v_{t+1}^j) = p_{ij}, p(v_t^i, v_{t+1}^i) = 1 - \beta_i`

Note: the input graph :math:`G` is pre-generated through a random Gnp graph with :math:`n = 30` and :math:`p = 0.4`. We further transform 
:math:`G` to a directed acyclic graph by keeping only edges directing from lower indices to higher indices.
The resulting graph is stored in **DAG.graphml**.

Sources of Randomness:
----------------------
1. A node :math:`v_t` would be activated initially following a Bernoulli distribution with :math:`p = u_v^t`.

2. An edge :math:`e` would be activated following a Bernoulli distribution with :math:`p = p_e`, where :math:`p_e` corresponds to the edge weight.

Model Factors:
--------------
* num_subgraph: Number of subgraphs to generate.

    * Default: 10

* num_group: Number of node groups.

    * Default: 3

* init_prob: Probability of initiating the nodes for each group at each time step.

    * Default: np.array([0.05, 0, 0] * 10)

* T: Number of time steps for the cascade process.

    * Default: 10

* beta: Probability of de-activating a node at each time step.

    * Default: 0.4

Respones:
---------
* mean_num_activated: The average total number of activated nodes among all subgraphs.

* mean_num_activated_end: Mean number of activated nodes at the end.
