Solver: Stochastic Trust-Region Response-Surface Method (STRONG)
================================================================

Description:
------------
The solver estimates the shape of the underlying response distribution, 
through function evaluations taken within a neighborhood of the incumbent solution.
STRONG has two stages in each iteration where a sub trust region is defined: 
stage I optimizes a first-order polynomial, and stage II optimizes a second-order 
polynomial. If stage II fails to generate a good solution, an inner loop is initiated 
where value, gradient, and Hessian of the center point are further calculated.


Modifications & Implementation:
----------------------
Process within a stage:
We first find the Cauchy Point and the new solution in order to create a polynomial.
Then, the solver either shrinks trust region size, or move center point while trust 
regin size stays constant, or move center point while trust region enlarges.

Helper functions:
There are 3 helper functions in addition to the main algorithm. cauchy_point finds
the Cauchy Point by using the gradient and Hessian matrix to find the steepest descent
direction. check_cons checks the feasibility of the Cauchy point and update the 
point accordingly. Lastly, finite_diff uses finite difference to estimate gradients and 
BFGS to estimate Hessian matrix.

Hyperparameters:
The user has the option to assign different values than the defaults to the model 
factors n0, n_r, sensitivity, delta_threshold, delta_T, eta_0, eta_1, gamma_1, 
gamma_2, lambda, lambda_2 through changing fixed_factors.
