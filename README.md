# Welcome to SimOpt (MATLAB Edition)

This branch contains a previous stable version of the testbed written in MATLAB.

This [WSC paper](https://eckman.engr.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/233/2020/01/SimOptRevisions-paper.pdf) from 2019 gives a detailed overview of this version and how to run experiments; see Section 3 in particular.
